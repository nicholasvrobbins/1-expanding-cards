Summary: Following along with Brad and Florin doing 50 JavaScript projects to get better at JavaScript. This project was all about creating essentially 2 versions of cards, one big card that's active and one smaller card that's non-active and then utilizing JavaScript to switch between them. The JavaScript was pretty minimal but what it did add was really cool, essentially grabbing the panel class and on click it will 1) remove the class of active just in case it has it then 2) will add the class of active to that div that's clicked and within CSS we added a transition so it's a nice smooth fade in and out effect.
